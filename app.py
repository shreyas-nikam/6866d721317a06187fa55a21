In this lab, we explore the fundamentals of portfolio management with a focus on risk assessment and Investment Policy Statements (IPS). This interactive application allows you to understand your own risk profile and how it influences investment decisions. The application implements concepts from the "Basics of Portfolio Planning and Construction" document, especially concerning risk tolerance (page 6).

Key features include:
- Interactive risk profiling based on financial and psychometric factors.
- Visualization of your risk tolerance category.
- Definition of absolute and relative risk objectives.
