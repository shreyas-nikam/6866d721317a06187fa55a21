# QuLab: Interactive Portfolio Management and Risk Profiling Application

![QuLab Logo](https://www.quantuniversity.com/assets/img/logo5.jpg)

## Project Description

QuLab is an interactive Streamlit application designed as a lab project to explore the fundamental concepts of portfolio management, with a strong emphasis on risk assessment and Investment Policy Statements (IPS). This application allows users to understand their personal risk profile and how it influences critical investment decisions. It implements and visualizes concepts primarily drawn from the "Basics of Portfolio Planning and Construction" document, specifically focusing on risk tolerance assessment (inspired by page 6).

The application serves as an educational tool to grasp:
*   The interplay of financial factors (ability to bear risk) and psychometric factors (willingness to take risk).
*   The practical implications of defining absolute and relative risk objectives.
*   Basic principles of asset allocation based on risk tolerance.
*   A simplified introduction to Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and portfolio optimization.

## Features

*   **Interactive Risk Profiler**:
    *   Assess your "ability to bear risk" through financial questionnaires (income, net worth, liabilities, time horizon, dependents, income stability).
    *   Evaluate your "willingness to take risk" via psychometric questions.
    *   Visualize your overall risk tolerance category on a dynamic matrix, similar to "Exhibit 1: Risk Tolerance".
    *   Define custom absolute and relative risk objectives.
    *   Display underlying formulas for risk score calculations using LaTeX.
*   **Dynamic Asset Allocation**:
    *   Provides a rule-based asset allocation model (Stocks, Bonds, Cash) tailored to selected risk tolerance levels (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive).
    *   Visualizes asset distribution using interactive Pie Charts.
*   **Simplified Portfolio Optimization**:
    *   Demonstrates core concepts of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).
    *   Uses a sample dataset of asset returns and covariance.
    *   Performs a brute-force optimization to identify a portfolio with the highest Sharpe Ratio.
    *   Visualizes the efficient frontier (Risk vs. Return) with the optimal portfolio highlighted.
*   **Intuitive User Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an engaging and easy-to-use experience, featuring a clear sidebar navigation.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
*   **pip**: Python's package installer, usually comes with Python.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/quolab.git
    cd quolab
    ```
    *(Replace `https://github.com/your-username/quolab.git` with the actual repository URL)*

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    *   **On Windows**:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux**:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Create a `requirements.txt` file in the root of your project with the following content:

    ```
    streamlit>=1.0
    pandas
    numpy
    plotly>=5.0
    ```

    Then, install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the Streamlit application.

1.  **Run the Application**:
    Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal (where `app.py` is located) and run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2.  **Access the Application**:
    A new tab in your default web browser should automatically open, displaying the QuLab application. If not, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` (or the address shown in your terminal).

3.  **Navigation**:
    *   Use the **sidebar on the left** to navigate between the different sections of the application:
        *   **Risk Profiler**: Input your financial and psychometric details to assess your risk tolerance.
        *   **Asset Allocation**: See a sample asset allocation based on different risk tolerance levels.
        *   **Portfolio Optimization**: Explore a simplified demonstration of MPT concepts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a modular structure for better maintainability and readability.

```
quolab/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
└── application_pages/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── page1.py
    ├── page2.py
    └── page3.py
```

*   `app.py`: The main entry point of the Streamlit application. It sets up the page configuration, sidebar navigation, and imports functions from the `application_pages` directory to render specific content based on user selection.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python packages and their versions required to run the application.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing project documentation.
*   `application_pages/`: A directory containing individual Python scripts for each distinct page or section of the application.
    *   `__init__.py`: An empty file that tells Python this directory should be treated as a package.
    *   `page1.py`: Contains the code for the "Risk Profiler" section, including questionnaires, score calculations, and visualizations.
    *   `page2.py`: Contains the code for the "Asset Allocation" section, demonstrating basic asset distribution models.
    *   `page3.py`: Contains the code for the "Portfolio Optimization" section, showcasing simplified MPT principles and calculations.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python**: The core programming language.
*   **Streamlit**: The open-source app framework used to build interactive web applications purely in Python.
*   **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly in the Portfolio Optimization section.
*   **NumPy**: Essential for numerical operations, especially for array manipulation and calculations in portfolio optimization.
*   **Plotly**: Utilized for creating interactive and informative visualizations (scatter plots, pie charts) to present data clearly.
